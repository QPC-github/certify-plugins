Example Deployment Tasks
--------------------------

This is a collection of example and user contributed tasks which can be incorporated into Certify The Web when installed as a custom plugin.

- Custom Task : implements an example custom deployment task
- Azure DevOps : implements a certificate thumbprint update to an Azure Devops Variable group. Contributed by Timo Jansen (<a href="madesmart.nl" target="_blank">madesmart.nl</a>)

> Note that custom plugins need to be maintained in line with new Certify The Web releases and you should test your plugin with each new release, especially major version updates.
