Custom Task Plugin Example
---------------------------------

- Custom plugins can be loaded by Certify The Web if placed in C:\ProgramData\Certfy\plugins
- Additional dependency DLLs must also be copied to the same location. Minimising your dependencies is recommended.
- Do not copy plugins or content to the main \Program Files\CertifyTheWeb location as these will be removed on subsequent app updates.
- To enable custom plugin loading check `Settings > General > Enable Custom Plugin Loading`.
